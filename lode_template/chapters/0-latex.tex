\begin{myquotation}What is magic for? What use is wizardry if it cannot save a unicorn?\par\mbox{}\hfill\emdash{}Peter S. Beagle, \citetitle{lastunicorn2}\index{Beagle, Peter S.}\index{Last Unicorn, The@\textit{Last Unicorn, The}}\ifxetex\label{beagle-heroes-quote}\else~\citep[cf. p.~187f]{lastunicorn2}\fi\end{myquotation}

Even the best technologies cannot save a unicorn\emdash{}or make us better authors. They cannot tell us \textit{what} to write. But they can help us to bring our imagination and ideas onto paper more quickly and efficiently. All you need to become a successful author is your mind, a pen, and paper. Everything you need to become a published author \textit{more quickly} is in the following chapters.

While I try my best to explain each command and parameter, I keep those explanations focused on bringing you to the goal of publishing a book. There are other books meant to serve as a complete reference for all packages used in the template. Thus, it is best to look at Part 2 less as a reference and more as a walk-through to get your writing published using LaTeX.
