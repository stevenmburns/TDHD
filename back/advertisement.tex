% Remove the following section if you only want to show your covers, replace it with your own book descriptions.

In \citetitle{eBBWLtAW}\index{@\citetitle{eBBWLtAW}}\ifxetex\else{} \citep{eBBWLtAW}\fi (\url{https://www.amazon.com/Even-Better-Books-LaTeX-Agile-ebook/dp/B0BMZJ5LF7}), author Clemens Lode provides you a short-cut into the world of book publishing with LaTeX. It is not a book that just lists all the commands and then leaves you alone, it guides you alongside a fully working template (this one!).

% If you do not have or want covers displayed here, comment them out.
